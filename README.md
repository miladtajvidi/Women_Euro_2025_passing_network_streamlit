# UEFA Women's Euro 2025 Passing Network â€“ Streamlit App

This project provides an interactive, reproducible workflow for visualizing football passing networks using open StatsBomb data, with a focus on the UEFA Women's Euro 2025. The Streamlit app allows you to explore passing networks for any match in the dataset, with a clean, presentation-ready design.

## Features

- **Interactive Match Selection:** Choose any match from the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 dataset and instantly view passing networks for both teams.
- **Data Access:** Uses the `statsbombpy` library to access open StatsBomb event data.
- **Passing Network Calculation:** Extracts starting XIs, computes average player positions, and builds passing matrices for each team, focusing on completed passes between starting players.
- **Visualization:** Plots side-by-side passing networks for both teams using `mplsoccer` and `matplotlib`, with node sizes and edge widths scaled to reflect pass volume.
